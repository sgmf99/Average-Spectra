# Overview

I uploaded my most recent notebooks with temperature sliceplots, 2D Histograms, and spectra for five different rays.

## Slice Plots and 2D Hist. for All Gas

This notebook shows the x, y, and z temperature slice-plots for each ray and illustrates their corresponding 
2D rho-temperature histogram weighted by cell mass.


## 2D Histograms Only Scaled Differently 140

This notebook features the 2D rho-temperature histograms weighted by ion mass for each of our ions of interest. The colorbar is scaled equally among 
the same elements for all five rays but differently relative to other elements. This is useful when comparing the abundance of each ion and or element
in one ray to that of a different ray.

## 2D Histograms Only Scaled Equally 140

This notebook features the 2D rho-temperature histograms weighted by ion mass for each of our ions of interest. The colorbar is scaled 
equally in all plots. This is useful for comparing the abundance of each element and or ion to that of another element and or ion.

## Comparing Spectra 140

This notebook presents the simulated spectra of each ray. I used commonly observed lines found in literature except for Fe IV, Al IV, and Mg III,
which were obtained from a database.
