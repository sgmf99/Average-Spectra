# Overview

I created one-dimensional histograms of ion density weighted by ion mass (in M<sub>&odot;</sub>) and compared them to the density of all gas. Additionally, I studied the ion fraction of each element of interest using stacked histograms and found that most of the gas is made up of first and second ionized elements.
