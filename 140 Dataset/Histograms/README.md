# Overview

## 1D Temperature Histograms

This notebook shows one-dimensional stacked temperature histograms of the ions of interest within an element, weighted by ion mass. Only rays 2 and 3 are analyzed in this notebook since Ray 1 passes through mostly cool gas.

## 1D Velocity Histograms

This notebook shows one-dimensional stacked line-of-sight velocity histograms of the ions of interest within an element, weighted by ion mass. The binwidth of each histogram is equal to the velocity resolution (dv) of each line due to a COS instrument. Only rays 2 and 3 are analyzed in this notebook since Ray 1 passes through mostly cool gas.


## 2D Histograms Only Scaled Differently 140 (Reduced)

These notebooks feature the 2D rho-temperature histograms weighted by ion mass for each of our ions of interest. The colorbar is scaled equally among 
the same elements for all rays but differently relative to other elements. This is useful when comparing the abundance of each ion and or element
in one ray to that of a different ray.

## 2D Histograms Only Scaled Equally 140 (Reduced)

These notebooks feature the 2D rho-temperature histograms weighted by ion mass for each of our ions of interest. The colorbar is scaled 
equally in all plots. This is useful for comparing the abundance of each element and or ion to that of another element and or ion.
